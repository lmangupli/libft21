Libft
First project of School 21. Creating my own first library.

I recoded a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions.
The projects helps to build stronger algorithmic skills, better understating of Unix logic and introduces to imperative programming.

## How to use

Just type:
```
make
```
amd hit enter. And the library compiled!
